Hasura GraphQL Engine is a blazing-fast GraphQL server that gives you **instant, realtime GraphQL APIs over Postgres**, with [**webhook triggers**](event-triggers.md) on database events, and [**remote schemas**](remote-schemas.md) for business logic.

Hasura helps you build GraphQL apps backed by Postgres or incrementally move to GraphQL for existing applications using Postgres.

### Motivation for SharingCities

Add new datasource and construct relevant queries in a faster, more accesible way. Use online GraphQL editor to let frontend and backend developers see data the same way.

### Install your own server

There is currently an experimental server installed following [this guide](https://docs.hasura.io/1.0/graphql/manual/guides/deployment/digital-ocean-one-click.html#hasura-graphql-engine-one-click-app-on-digitalocean-marketplace). There are many other ways to deploy Hasura, so pick one that works for you.

Note that the test server is password protected, in order to use it you must ask the developers of this repository for access. We recommend installing your own to experiment instead, it's not a very complicated procedure.
