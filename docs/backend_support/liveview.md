comprehensive docs and examples to get up to speed:

- [Phoenix.LiveView docs for Elixir and JavaScript usage](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_live_view)

require more stability, it is recommended that you install using the
[installation guide on HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_live_view/installation.html).
If you want to use the latest features, you should follow the instructions
given in the markdown file [here](guides/introduction/installation.md).

#### Browser Support

All current Chrome, Safari, Firefox, and MS Edge are supported.
IE11 support is available

## Motivation for SharingCities

<i>While modern JavaScript tooling enables sophisticated client applications, it often comes at an extreme cost in complexity and maintainability. Thereâ€™s a common class of applications where rich experiences are needed, but full single-page applications are otherwise overkill to achieve the bits of required rich interaction.
